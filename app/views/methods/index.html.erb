<h1>Brew Methods</h1>
<p>Below are some descriptions about the various brew methods we investigate in the experiments and the typical ways they affect the taste of the.</p>

	    <p>Perhaps the simplest to understand is the Cafetière (French Press, or Press Pot). You add some coarsely ground coffee beans and some water, let them brew for a few minutes, and then use the metal plunger to seal the grounds in the pot while you pour. The result is a rich, full-bodied cup of coffee, with perhaps a little thickness or grittiness at the bottom if your ground is too fine.</p>

	    <p>If the grittiness isn't to your taste, you can use the clasic Pour Over method (Melitta or V60) with a paper filter instead. These tend to require a little more manual work than the Cafetière but the result is often a more detailed and refined taste where the oils and textures are removed, even if it lacks some of the richness.</p>

	    <p>To get back some of the fullness of taste of a Cafetière while still retaining some of the delicate flavours exposed by a pour-over you can use the Clever. The gadget, highly deserving of its name, combines the full immersion method with the filtering through a paper filter resulting in a pleasant balance of a rich body without getting overwhelmed by the grind texture.</p>
